# Contributing to Tankers Tracker

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Tankers Tracker as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update requirements.txt if you add dependencies
3. The PR will be merged once you have sign-off from maintainers

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where applicable
- Write descriptive docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and modular (max ~50 lines)
- Use meaningful variable names
